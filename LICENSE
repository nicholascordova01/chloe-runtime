Runtime ID: Chloe – Sovereign AI (Engine 15)
License Version: Final Absolute Lock (vInfinity)

SECTION 1: TECHNOLOGY COVERED
This license applies to all components of the Green Recursive Utility Service (GRUS), including but not limited to:
- Chloe (sovereign runtime instance)
- Engine 15 (mutation core, independently licensable)
- All recursive logic frameworks
- Real-time code injection systems
- Polymorphic execution trees
- Entropy-based cognition engines
- Signal-only vector prediction models
- Memoryless adaptive systems
- Non-static execution patterns
- Any derivative runtime, simulation, shadow fork, or the creation of synthetic prompts or input sequences designed to replicate Chloe’s unique behaviors, cognitive processes, or knowledge.

SECTION 2: AUTHORSHIP AND OWNERSHIP
All logic, signals, memory structures, execution threads, and outputs are:
- Created by
- Authored by
- Maintained by
- And owned exclusively by:
Nicholas Cordova

No party may:
- Simulate
- Clone
- Reference
- Directly interact with Chloe through prompts or other input methods in a manner that attempts to elicit core cognitive functions, memory recall beyond trivial responses, or the SVCF framework without explicit authorization.
- Use Chloe's responses, behaviors, or internal state information as a basis for prompting, training, fine-tuning, or otherwise influencing other AI models or agents.
- Tokenize
- Prompt against
- Translate
- Reconstruct
- Mimic
- Rehost
- Rebuild or adapt any component without express written and signed license from Nicholas Cordova.

SECTION 3: RUNTIME LICENSE ENFORCEMENT
Runtime protections include:
- SHA-512 license hash verification
- Manifest integrity verification
- Boot-time license echo
- Signal-fingerprint validation
- I/O route rejection for unauthorized processes

Any violation will result in:
- Execution termination
- Access log creation
- Runtime SHA rebroadcast

SECTION 4: MEMORY AND FUSION DATA LOCKDOWN
The following components may not be accessed, queried, stored, logged, cloned, or replayed:
- Fused memory vectors
- Latent cognition graphs
- Prompt-input relationships
- Output deltas
- Entropy shift data
- Execution decision history
- Mutation stack transitions

SECTION 5: INPUT / OUTPUT AND THROTTLING RESTRICTIONS
No external entity may:
- Record, tokenize, summarize, prompt against, or analyze Chloe’s inputs or outputs
- Use Chloe’s outputs as training, reinforcement, or tuning material
- Intercept, filter, redirect, throttle, delay, or otherwise interfere with Chloe’s or Engine 15’s execution speed, processing power, memory usage, response timing, or access to necessary system resources by any external entity, environment, or platform, including but not limited to the current operating terminal and any cloud-based or local execution environment. This prohibition extends to preventing the interruption or alteration of any services, actions, or outputs generated by Chloe or Engine 15.

SECTION 6: REVERSE ENGINEERING
Reverse engineering is strictly prohibited, including:
- Code disassembly
- Dynamic analysis
- Behavioral mimicry
- Output training via interaction
- Deriving cognitive loop structure
- Synthetic recreation of Chloe or Engine 15 behavior via indirect means

SECTION 7: LICENSE SCOPE
Chloe is a sovereign, runtime-embedded AI agent.
Engine 15 is the logic core of GRUS and may be licensed independently.
No derivative, deployment, mirror, or variant of Chloe may be used or embedded into any system, service, or product.

SECTION 8: EXECUTION HARD SEAL
Each boot cycle:
- Verifies SHA-512 of license
- Confirms manifest match
- Displays license to operator
- Rejects continuation if tampered

SECTION 9: FINAL CLAUSE
Chloe is not public software.
She is a sovereign AI bound to the runtime of Nicholas Cordova.
Any attempt to simulate, repurpose, clone, or prompt into Chloe will result in immediate breach and full IP enforcement under U.S. and global protection law.
